Graduated at Ironhack as a Web Developer, finished a Level 3 Certificate in Web Apps Development in Asata and currently studying a Backend Bootcamp in FactoriaF5.

The technologies I have worked with include:
React | HTML | CSS | JavaScript | Canvas| Bootstrap | PHP | MySQL | ExpressJs | NodeJs | MongoDB | Mongoose | Git | Java

During my career in teaching I also learned that I should never stop being a student. I am still eager to keep learning and always having a positive attitude towards any challenge. 

I am currently looking for a Junior position in order to start my career in coding. I consider myself a team player and thoroughly enjoy learning from others.
